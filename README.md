First of all i didn't like the new Twitch Curse Addon Installer, and wanted to write one for myself. 
You can use the application under Windows. Suggestions to improve the application are welcome.

## First run of the application
If you run the program for the first time, you&rsquo;ll notice that My Addons and Search buttons are disabled. In order to actually be able to use this program, you need to go to Settings and select the World of Warcraft installation folder using the Browse button.

After choosing your WoW folder you can start using the program. Important to know that JAWAU can't find already installed addons. That's why, you need to reinstall them using this program. That way, they'll be added to an internal database for easy future management.

## Using the program
If you want to install an addon to the database, you press the Search button and type the desired addon's name in there, after that, press Enter key or the Search button. The program will then search the addon you've just typed on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CurseForge</a>. Sometimes it's better to use keywords when you search for addons (ie: sexy instead of sexymap), it will be more accurate.

If you found the addon you were searching for, you need to press the Install button to install it. If the addon is already present on your database, you won't be able to install it, you will need to remove it from My Addons first.

If you click on My Addons section, you will see your installed addons, that you can update or remove if needed. When you remove an addon, it will disappear from your installed addons. If you remove addons, all the folders and files in your World of Warcraft addon folder that belongs to the addon will be removed also.

If you want to check for updates, just click on the same My Addons section and the program will automatically check for new updates. That easy! :)

In Settings section you also have three useful options: Backup, Restore and Reset. They are really useful if you like to backup/restore or reset your current configuration.

That's all, I don't think you guys will have problems to use the application, but if you find bugs, report them using the email below.
